### JavaScript Loan Calculator
==============================
An extended example of a loan calculator web app written in plain
vanillaJS. Using ES5 style JavaScript
See (JavaScript: The Definitive Guide)[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/0596000480/ch01s08.html] by David Flanagan.

I will later implement the same web app using modern
ES6+ JS syntax and/or some modern JS libraries such as React and possibly D3.js.
