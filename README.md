JavaScript Loan Calculator
==========================

An extended example of a loan calculator web app written in plain
vanillaJS. Using ES5 style JavaScript
See [JavaScript: The Definitive Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/javascript-the-definitive/0596000480/ch01s08.html) by David Flanagan.

I will later implement the same web app using
ES6+ JS syntax and some a modern JS libraries or framework such as React (and the D3.js library) or AngularJS.
